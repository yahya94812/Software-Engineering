In GitHub projects, a **license** defines what others are legally allowed (and not allowed) to do with your code. Without a license, **your project is automatically copyrighted**, meaning people _cannot_ legally reuse, modify, or distribute your code—even if it's public.

Here's a clear breakdown:

## 🔍 **What is a License?**

A license is a legal document you include in your repository (usually as a `LICENSE` file) that tells others:

* Can they **use** your code?
    
* Can they **modify** it?
    
* Can they **redistribute** it?
    
* Can they **use it commercially**?
    
* Do they need to **give credit**?
    
* Do they need to **open-source** their changes?

## ⭐ Common Licenses on GitHub (with simple meanings)

### **1. MIT License**

* ✔ Free to use, modify, distribute
    
* ✔ Commercial use allowed
    
* ✔ Only requirement: include the original license + copyright
    
* ❌ No warranty  
    👉 **Most permissive and popular**
    

* * *

### **2. Apache License 2.0**

* Same freedoms as MIT
    
* Adds **patent protection**, so companies prefer it  
    👉 Good for businesses
    

* * *

### **3. GPL (GNU General Public License)**

* ✔ Free to use, modify, distribute
    
* ❗ If someone modifies your code and distributes it, they **must open-source** their changes (copyleft)  
    👉 Good for ensuring open-source stays open
    

Variants:

* **GPLv3** (most restrictive)
    
* **LGPL** (less strict—libraries can be used in closed-source software)
    

* * *

### **4. BSD Licenses (2-Clause or 3-Clause)**

* Similar to MIT but with different wording
    
* Permissive
    

* * *

### **5. Creative Commons (CC) Licenses**

* For **art, docs, images** (not ideal for code)
    
* Examples: CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, CC-BY-NC

## 💡 Why Should You Add a License?

* It tells people how they can use your project
    
* Encourages contribution
    
* Avoids legal confusion
    
* Makes your code more shareable
